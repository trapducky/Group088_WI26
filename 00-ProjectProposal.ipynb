    "\n",
    "Steam, one of the most prominent online gaming platforms with millions of daily players, is home to thousands of shooting games. With the intense competition between video games of the same genre, each game must be able to portray and sell their uniqueness to emerge victorious in the rivalry between industries. A game can achieve this through creating outstanding graphical animations, developing special gameplay mechanics, reducing monetary costs, sharing connections to popular series or creators, and marketing to spread awareness. However, if a game fails to do so, it may not meet the expectations of the player community, resulting in what’s known as a flop (collectively acknowledged failures). Therefore, how do the developers and publishers of live-service shooting games anticipate a game’s commercial success of revenue and critical success of player reviews and engagement shortly after launch, or even before release, to prevent flops that can result in financial and occupational risks?\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, factors like price can greatly influence consumer behavior as there are over 1800 free to play shooter games on Steam, with Counter-Strike 2 and PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS being the most widely known. Yet, even with more expensive price tags, games like Arc Raiders (launched at $40 USD) and Red Dead Redemption 2 (launched at $60 USD) still received great feedback in response to positive early reviews. To fully grasp the correlation between certain factors and a game’s success, our team will analyze the results of pre-launch data and early post-launch data to determine how to best achieve success. We were motivated in this research due to our familiarity in playing video games, especially those that include shooting aspects. Despite playing in the same category of video games, we each have our own personal favorites when it comes down to shooting games. Consequently, we noticed that although every game provides a different experience, we all seem to enjoy those different aspects of the game. Therefore, we are curious to see the impacts on success of the various characteristics a game features.\n",

     "## Prior Work\n",
    "Similar questions have been asked by several researchers in the past, for instance, by researcher and data scientist David Nabergoj. David and his team sought out to predict the popularity of games on Steam. To elaborate, the study attempted to discover the relationship between the popularity of the game and its features. Using Bayesian models, the game's popularity was measured before and after its release, which was contingent on its price, storage size, supported languages, release date, and genre. Their findings concluded that a genre-based hierarchical model performed the best, as well as certain genres and early release dates were strongly associated with higher player counts.\n",

    "To understand the HTML here, `<a name=\"#...\"> </a>` is a tag that allows you produce a named reference for a given location.  Markdown has the construciton `[text with hyperlink](#named reference)` that will produce a clickable link that transports you the named reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset their model operated on consisted of games released after 2015. Gathered from three disparate sources, Steam API, Stream Spy, which offers data not available from Steam's API, and Steam DB, a historical database of player count. Price, and system requirements were the primary aim of their data wrangling procedure. Cheaper games are, generally, more popular, and the more storage a game requires, the greater the budget, inferring the higher the reputation of the game . Upon cleaning their data they were left with a dataset upwards of 8,000 games.\n",
    "\n",
    "The prediction aimed to correctly analyze the median player count by the second month upon the game's release. By utilizing simple regression models it was found that, not only were most games cheap and minimal in storage size, but overwhelmed by outliers as well. Certain categories such as developers and publishers were dropped from categorical features as there were too many confounding variables. The player counts peaked the first month after release, and numbers plateaued the second. Therefore, it can be said that the first month is paramount in predicting success. Marginal factors included supported languages, storage size, price, and the time at which the game was released.\n"

    "- 1. Revenue: We predict that pre-launch follower counts will be the strongest predictor of initial revenue. However, 48-hour retention rate will more accurately forecast revenue in the long term. This is because live-service games rely on recurring transactions for sustained revenue, and many players will leave shortly after launch.\n",
    "- 2. Monthly Active Users: We predict that the peak concurrent users in the first 48 hours and online popularity will have a non-linear correlation, retaining a fraction of those users after six months. This is because the hype around a game spikes and dies down gradually over time (exponential decay).\n",
    "- 3. Positive Reviews: We predict that the company/developer’s previous successful titles and early review sentiments will correlate with a game’s future reviews. This is because people might favor or dislike games based on their feelings towards its creator and early review can be an indicator for future review trends.\n",

 "### Ideal Variables\n",
 "Our variables will be grouped into categories based on the initial pre-release date, the game’s information, and the post-release data. The initial pre-release variables will include the amount of users that have the game on their wishlist, number of followers on Steam, and Google trend scores of related searches. The game information will have data on the initial price, file size, supported platforms, and popularity of the developers. Early release variables will be peak concurrent users and review sentiments. Lastly the post release variables will be the amount of downloads, revenue in a year's period, monthly active user/retention, and final Steam review scores.\n",
 "\n",
 "### Ideal Number of Observations\n",
 "Model accuracy improves with larger datasets, so ideally we would include all FPS or shooter games available on Steam. We estimate that this will result in several hundred to over one thousand games, providing enough data for reliable statistical analysis and predictive modeling.\n",
 "\n",
 "### Data Collection\n",
 "The data will be generated by Steam users, game developers and publishers, and public web platforms like Google Tends. We will collect the data using a combination of the Steam Web API, SteamSpy datasets, and public web sources. The Steam API provides structured information about each game such as release date, price, supported platforms, and review scores. SteamSpy can estimate player counts, ownership, and engagement metrics. Lastly Google Trends will be used to measure pre-release search interest and additional engagement metrics may be collected through public APIs or web scraping tools. These sources will be merged using a unique game identifier using Steam AppID.\n",
 "\n",
 "### Data Storage and Organization\n",
 "The data will be organized in a tabular format where each row represents one game and each column will represent the variables. Data will be stored as CSV and JSON files and loaded into pandas DataFrames for cleaning and analysis. Games will be linked across datasets using the Steam AppID as a unique key. Separate raw datasets will be kept unchanged, while cleaned and merged versions will be saved as processed datasets. \n",

 "**Steam Web API**  \n",

 "The official Steam Web API is documented at the Steam developers site and provides access to game metadata and user statistics. To use it, you must register for a Steam API key using your Steam account that has bought a game in the last year. Requests can be made via HTTPS to endpoints. The API will return variables like release date, supported platforms, price, and review scores. \n",
 "\n",
 "**SteamSpy API**  \n",
 "https://steamspy.com/api.php  \n",
 "This dataset provides publicly accessible JSON files for retrieving summary information about the games we are analyzing on Steam. No special permissions or API keys are required to use to gain access but the file has detailed instructions on how to access specific datasets through HTTPS queries. Data can be downloaded by building an API request URL with specific parameters such as tags, genres, or AppIDs. \n",
 "\n",
 "**Google Trends API**  \n",
 "https://github.com/luminati-io/google-trends-api  \n",
 "This Github link has access to a Node.js interface of Google Trends. Allowing for programmed access to Google search trend data without needing a formal Google Cloud API key. Using this API, you can request search interests over time with specific keywords related to FPS game titles. "
